First, you need to install Docker on your computer. 
https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
You can follow the link above and go through the steps to install based on your operating system. 

Python3 and the solc solidity compiler must also be installed on your system before the tool can work properly. 
You can install Python from here:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

Then you must open the terminal to install the solidity compiler. It can be installed by using Node.js or Docker.
For Node run: npm install -g solc
For Docker: docker run ethereum/solc:stable --help

Now we can use Docker to run the Slither tool.
Run the following: 
docker pull trailofbits/eth-security-toolbox
docker run -it -v /home/share:/share trailofbits/eth-security-toolbox

Now Slither is installed on your machine. To run the program, simply type slither in the terminal 
To run the program on specific contracts type slither and then the contract address such as: slither 0x12...34

Running this will print some information out, but it may be difficult to understand. You can print a human readable summary as well as a few other options. 
Here is a link to the documentation: https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Printer-documentation#human-summary
